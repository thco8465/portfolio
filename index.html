							<h1>Thomas' Portfolio</h1>
							<p class="major">Introduction</p>
							<p><strong>Senior at CU Boulder</strong></p>
							<p> In May 2024, I will graduate with a BA in CS and a minor in philosophy. The BA in CS fits my wholistic approach to problem solving mixed with effective communicating. My focus is on software engineering as I look to refine my programming skills and meet fellow engineers! Outside of programming, you can find me running, practicing yoga, playing guitar, and reading outside!</p>

							<h2>About Me</h2>
							<p>I spent my first ten years growing up in Phoenix, Arizona and developed a love for the scorching desert heat! I then spent the next ten years in Crystal Lake, Illinois where my father is from. Here, I learned to endure the midwest winters and appreciate each of the four seasons. As a result, I love to spend time outdoors and adventure to find new experiences. My strongest quality after all these years is my desire for change and to constantly develop as a virtue ethicist.</p>

							<h2>Why CU Boulder?</h2>
							<p>When looking for colleges, I wanted to go to one where people seem the healthiest</p>
							<p>This led me to CU Boulder which was reported as having a rigorous rebuilt computer science cirriculum as well as having one of the most active communities in the US!</p>
							<p>I feel extremely privledged to have come from a little suburb in the midwest to one of the most beautiful colleges around and have a taste of paradise!</p>
							<p>Oftentimes, I felt like a fish out of water, but I truly believe it has allowed me to mature emotionally and socially</p>
